# No more excuses for not writing end-to-end testing : Playwright in practice

End-to-end tests are rarely used because they are considered slow, fragile and difficult to write and maintain. They would be so restrictive for the devs that they even invented the job of automatician. Come and reconcile yourself with web testing thanks to Playwright! 
  
In this session, you will learn :
- How to install and configure Playwright Test
- Create your first test in a few clicks with Codegen
- Make relevant and robust selectors that do not rely on implementation
- Impress your colleagues with fast tests, on the most popular browsers
